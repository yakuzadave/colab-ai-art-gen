# colab-ai-art-gen
A Google Colab Notebook for using CLIP to generate AI art from text prompts

## Instructions 
Make sure to check out the Jupyter Notebook that is within this repository for examples.  This file also includes a link so that you can run the Notebook within Google Colab

## Roadmap

### Adding in Google Drive Integration
- I would like to add in the ability to save the resulting images (or video) directly to Google Driove
- Add in ability to save the checkpoints and models to Google Drive.
- Add in loading checkpoints and modals from Google Drive

### Add Loading of Text Prompts From Google Sheets
- Rather than just relyng on adding in prompts through the form,  it would be pretty cool to be able to load these from a Google Sheet by leveraging the built-in auth in Google Colab and `gspread`
